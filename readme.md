# Notes

Things to be noted for some of the solutions

## Reply Challenge

Since it was a team challenge, not all of the code is mine.  (i.e. P5 was a combination of all the team members)

## USACO

Not all problems use the USACO style file I/O, some use `stdin`/`stdout`

## Codeforces

Codeforces submissions should be updated with the command `get-submissions -h Plasmatic; get-submissions -h zey_zey_chen`

If `get-submissions` is not found, run `npm i -g get-submissions`

## WLMOJ

The moose20 contests were done as a team as well.
